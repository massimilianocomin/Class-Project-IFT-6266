# Class-Project-IFT-6266
Class project for IFT6266 : Conditional Image Generation


In this repository I will store the codes necessary for the class project.

The 'lib' directory contains Layers and Dataset utilities shared by all codes.

The 'code' directory contains the different algorithms I'll be using.

For now, I've implemented only a convolutional autoencoder. The next steps are to implement an overcomplete dense layer instead of undercomplete and to use batch normalization as it has been done by many other in the class.
